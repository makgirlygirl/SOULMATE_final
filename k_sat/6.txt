It is the responsibility of management to prevent or, at least, to ease these fears. (1) For example, robots could be introduced only in new plants rather than replacing humans in existing assembly lines. (2) It may be that robots are needed to reduce manufacturing costs so that the company remains competitive, but planning for such cost reductions should be done jointly by labor and management. (3) Retraining current employees for new positions within the company will also greatly reduce their fear of being laid off. (4) Since robots are particularly good at highly repetitive simple motions, the replaced human workers should be moved to positions where judgment and decisions beyond the abilities of robots are required.

(1) Since cinema was an entirely fantasmatic art, these innovations were completely unnecessary. (2) And what’s worse, they could do nothing but turn filmmakers and audiences away from the fantasmatic dimension of cinema, potentially transforming film into a mere delivery device for representations of reality. (3) As long as the irrealism of the silent black and white film predominated, one could not take filmic fantasies for representations of reality. (4) But sound and color threatened to create just such an illusion, thereby destroying the very essence of film art. (5) As Rudolf Arnheim puts it, 'The creative power of the artist can only come into play where reality and the medium of representation do not coincide.

(1) The use of a paradigm in research typically addresses related problems by employing shared concepts, symbolic expressions, experimental and mathematical tools and procedures, and even some of the same theoretical statements.  Scientists need only understand how to use these various elements in ways that others would accept. (2) Indeed, one role of a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully without having to provide a detailed account of what they are doing or what they believe about it. (3) Thomas Kuhn noted that scientists “can agree in their identification of a paradigm without agreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a full interpretation or rationalization of it. (4) Lack of a standard interpretation or of an agreed reduction to rules will not prevent a paradigm from guiding research. (5)”", "answer": 2, "e1": 1, "e2": 2, "e3": 3, "e4": 4, "e5": 5}

(1) Concert performances become interesting and gain in attraction from the fact that they go far beyond the information printed in the score.  In his early studies on musical performance, Carl Seashore discovered that musicians only rarely play two equal notes in exactly the same way.  Within the same metric structure, there is a wide potential of variations in tempo, volume, tonal quality and intonation. (2) Such variation is based on the composition but diverges from it individually. (3) We generally call this ‘expressivity’. (4) It also explains why it is worthwhile for following generations to repeat the same repertoire. (5) New, inspiring interpretations help us to expand our understanding, which serves to enrich and animate the music scene. ", "answer": 4, "e1": 1, "e2": 2, "e3": 3, "e4": 4, "e5": 5}

(1) Taxing certain goods or services, and so increasing prices, should result in either decreased use of these resources or creative innovation of new sources or options. (2) Many examples of such “green taxes” exist. (3) Facing landfill costs, labor expenses, and related costs in the provision of garbage disposal, for example, some cities have required households to dispose of all waste in special trash bags, purchased by consumers themselves, and often costing a dollar or more each.  The results have been greatly increased recycling and more careful attention by consumers to packaging and waste. (4) By internalizing the costs of trash to consumers, there has been an observed decrease in the flow of garbage from households. (5)", "answer": 2, "e1": 1, "e2": 2, "e3": 3, "e4": 4, "e5": 5}

(1) Writers, by contrast, dive into the unruly, untamed depths of human experiences. (2) What he said about understanding memory can be extended to our questions about young children’s minds. (3) If we psychologists are too bent on identifying the orderly pattern, the regularities of children’s minds, we may miss an essential and pervasive characteristic of our topic: the child’s more unruly and imaginative ways of talking and thinking.

(1) According to this view, the (or perhaps, a) goal of science is to construct an economical framework of laws or generalizations that are capable of subsuming all observable phenomena.  Scientific explanations organize and systematize our knowledge of the empirical world; the more economical the systematization, the deeper our understanding of what is explained. (2) The other view is the causal/mechanical approach. (3) According to it, a scientific explanation of a phenomenon consists of uncovering the mechanisms that produced the phenomenon of interest. (4) This view sees the explanation of individual events as primary, with the explanation of generalizations flowing from them. (5) That is, the explanation of scientific generalizations comes from the causal mechanisms that produce the regularities. ", "answer": 1, "e1": 1, "e2": 2, "e3": 3, "e4": 4, "e5": 5}
